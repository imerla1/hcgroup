                <li class="list-item">
                    Upon placing an instruction to effect a trade using the Services (an
                    “Order”), your Account will be updated to reflect the open Order and
                    your Order will be included in HC Group’s order book for matching
                    with Orders from other Users. If all or a portion of your Order is
                    matched with another User, the Services will execute an exchange (a
                    “Trade”). Upon execution of a Trade, your Account will be updated to
                    reflect that the Order has either been closed due to having been
                    fully executed, or updated to reflect any partial fulfillment of the
                    Order. Orders will remain open until fully executed or cancelled in
                    accordance with subsection (b) below. For purposes of effectuating a
                    Trade, you authorize HC Group to take temporary control of the
                    Digital Currency that you are disposing of in the Trade.

                <li class="list-item">
                    You may only cancel an order initiated via the Services if such
                    cancellation occurs before your Order has been matched with an Order
                    from another user. Once your Order has been matched with an Order
                    from another user, you may not change, withdraw, or cancel your
                    authorization for HC Group to complete such Order. If any order has
                    been partially matched, you may cancel the unmatched portion of the
                    Order unless and until the unmatched portion has been matched. HC
                    Group reserves the right to refuse any cancellation request
                    associated with an Order after you have submitted such Order. If you
                    have an insufficient amount of Digital Currency in your Account to
                    fulfill an Order, HC Group may cancel the entire Order or may
                    fulfill a partial Order that can be covered by the Digital Currency
                    in your Account (in each case after deducting any fees payable to HC
                    Group in connection with the Trade as described in subsection (c)

                    prospectively to any trades or other transactions that take place
                    following the effective date of such updated fees. You authorize HC

                    forked coins split from any blockchain asset in your margin or futures account, even if you have not
                    engaged in any margin, futures trading or borrowing at all.</li>
                <li class="list-item" style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>3. </strong>The loan carries risks and the
                    value of your blockchain assets may drop. If the value of your assets drops below a certain level,
                    you are responsible for responding to this market circumstance.</li>
                <li class="list-item" style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>4. </strong>Under certain market conditions,
                    you may find it difficult or impossible to liquidate a position. This can occur, for example, there
                    is insufficient liquidity in the market or due to technical issues on HC Group.</li>
                <li class="list-item" style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>5. </strong>Placing contingent orders will not
                    necessarily limit your losses to the intended amounts, since market conditions may make it
                    impossible to execute such orders.</li>
                <li class="list-item" style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>6. </strong>There is no guaranteed measure
                    against losses on margin or futures trading. As a borrower, you may sustain a total loss beyond what
                    you have deposited to your margin or futures account.</li>
                <strong>b. To enter into margin or futures trading:</strong>

                    Department).</li>
                <li class="list-item" style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>2. </strong>You should fully understand the
                    risks associated with the margin or futures trading and lending and solely responsible and liable

                    transaction or invest in funds that are above your financial abilities;</li>
                <li class="list-item" style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>3. </strong>You are solely responsible and
                    liable for knowing the true status of any position, even if presented incorrectly by HC Group at any
                    time;</li>
                <li class="list-item" style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>4. </strong>You agree to maintain in your HC
                    Group margin or futures account a sufficient amount of blockchain assets required by HC Group for
                    users to engage in margin or futures trading and return your loan in full timely. Failure to
                    maintain a sufficient amount of assets or fail to return outstanding loan duly can result in the
                    forced-liquidation of assets in your margin or futures account;</li>
                <li class="list-item" style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>5. </strong>HC Group cannot guarantee to stop
                    losses even with the ability to force-liquidate any of your positions. If, after your positions are
                    liquidated, your assets are insufficient to cover the outstanding loan, you are still responsible
                    for any additional assets shortfall;</li>
                <li class="list-item" style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>6. </strong>HC Group may, in its sole
                    discretion, perform measures to mitigate potential losses to you on your behalf, including, but not
                    limited to, transferring balances from your margin or futures to your exchange account and/or from
                    your exchange to your margin or futures account;</li>
                <li class="list-item" style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>7. </strong>During HC Group system maintenance,
                    you agree that you are solely responsible and liable for managing your margin or futures account
                    under risk, including but not limited to, keep or close your position and repay your loan.</li>
                <li class="list-item" style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>8. </strong>You agree that you conduct all
                    trading, margin trading, futures trading and/or borrowing on your own account and claim full
                    responsibility for your activities. HC Group does not take any responsibility for any loss or damage
                    incurred as a result of your use of any services or your failure to understand the risks involved
                    associated with assets use generally or your use of our services.</li>
                <li class="list-item" style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>9. </strong>You are aware that on liquidation,
                    all open orders are immediately cancelled. you may lose all your positions and all the funds in your
                    futures account. A fee of up to 0.5% of the NOMINAL position value will be charged. If HC Group
                    cannot close all the positions on liquidation, the insurance fund and/or counterparty-liquidation
                    will take effect. HC Group takes every possible step to avoid counterparty liquidation to minimize
                    the potential impact of any counterparty liquidation when it does occur. Unfortunately, due to the
                    volatility in the crypto markets, and the high leverage offered to clients, it is not possible to
                    fully avoid this possibility. In order to provide the best possible client experience, HC Group
                    strive to keep counterparty liquidations to an absolute minimum.</li>
