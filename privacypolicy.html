      <strong>[Last revised: February 2020]</strong>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p class="margin-bottom">
        This Privacy Policy explains how Lucky Winner Ltd. (herein referred to
        as ‘HC Group’ or the ‘Company’) and its Affiliates collects, uses,
        shares, and protects user information obtained through the HC Group
        website. The terms “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Lucky Winner Limited,
        HC Group and its affiliates. When we ask for certain personal
        information from users it is because we are required by law to collect
        this information or it is relevant for specified purposes. Any
        non-required information you provide to us is done so voluntarily. You
        decided whether to provide us with non-required information; you may not
        be able to access or utilize all of our Services if you choose not to.
      </p>
      <p class="margin-bottom">
        By using the Site, you consent to the data practices described in this
        Privacy Policy. On occasion, HC Group may revise this Privacy Policy to
        reflect changes in law or our personal data collection and use
        practices. If material changes are made to this Privacy Policy, the
        changes will be announced by posting on the site. We will ask for your
        consent before using your information for any purpose that is not
        covered in this Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p class="margin-bottom">
        The latest privacy policy has incorporated elements from the General
        Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as we act in accordance with its
        personal information processing rules within the European Economic Area
        (EEA).
      </p>
      <h2>INFORMATION HC GROUP COLLECTS</h2>
      <p class="margin-bottom">
        We want you to understand the types of information we collect when you
        register for and use HC Group’s services
      </p>
      <strong>Information you provide to us at registration</strong>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        When you create an HC Group Account, you provide us with personal
        information that includes your contact information (email address, name,
        and a password). You can also choose to add a phone number for SMS or
        Google Authenticator account to be used for 2FA verification for
        improved security.
      </p>
      <strong>Information we collect when authenticating user identity</strong>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        To comply with global industry regulatory standards including Anti-Money
        Laundering (AML), Know-Your-Customer (KYC), and Counter-Terrorist
        Financing (CTF), HC Group requires user accounts to undergo user
        identity authentication for both Personal & Enterprise-level accounts.
        This entails collecting formal identification.
      </p>
      <strong>Information we collect as you use our services</strong>
      <br /><br />
      <strong>Service Usage Information</strong>
      <p>
        Through your use of the HC Group platform, we also monitor and collect
        tracking information related to usages such as access date & time,
        device identification, operating system, browser type and IP address.
        This information may be directly obtained by HC Group or through
        third-party services. This service usage data helps us our systems to
        ensure that our interface is accessible for users across all platforms
        and can aid during criminal investigations.
      </p>
      <strong>Transaction Information</strong>
      <p class="margin-btoom">
        For all personal and enterprise user accounts, we collect transaction
        information including deposit snapshots, account balances, trade
        history, withdrawals, order activity and distribution history. This
        transaction data is monitored for suspicious trading activity for user
        fraud protection, and legal case resolution.
      </p>
      <strong>WHY DOES HC GROUP COLLECT THIS INFORMATION?</strong>
      <p class="margin-bottom">
        To provide and maintain our services We use the information collected to

      <p class="margin-bottom">
        We use the IP address and unique identifiers stored in your device’s
        cookies to help us authenticate your identity and provide our service.
        Given our legal obligations and system requirements, we cannot provide
        you with services without data like identification, contact information
        and transaction-related information.
      </p>
      <p class="margin-bottom"></p>
      <strong>to protect our users</strong>

        accounts and archives.
      </p>

        such as spam, phishing and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
      </p>
      <p class="margin-bottom">
        We analyze trading activity with the goal of detecting suspicious
        behavior early to prevent potential fraud and loss of funds to bad
        actors.

        We use personal information collected, like an email address to interact
        with users directly when providing customer support on a ticket or to
        keep you informed on log ins, transactions, and security. Without
        processing your personal information for confirming each communication,
        we will not be able to respond to your submitted requests, questions and
        inquiries. All direct communications are kept confidential and reviewed
        internally for accuracy.

        review, investigate and prevent any potentially prohibited or illegal
        activities that violate our Terms of Service. For the benefit of our
        entire user base, we carefully enforce our agreements with third parties
        and actively investigate violations of our posted Terms of Use. HC Group
